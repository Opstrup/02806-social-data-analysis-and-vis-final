    description: "Solely doing exploratory data analysis on the map does not give any conclusive evidence of crimes being more prevalent in unlit areas. Crime actually appears to be more prevalent in well lit areas. However population density, socioeconomic parameters and many other unknown factors also need to be taken into consideration. The hypothesis that an increase in street lights reduce crime, has been studied thoroughly <a href='https://www.citylab.com/equity/2014/02/street-lights-and-crime-seemingly-endless-debate/8359/' target='_blank'>[1]</a> <a href='https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/156d/53ac6dcdae6665acee8c7da2afbff8f61c15.pdf' target='_blank'>[2]</a>, and no conclusive evidence was found. However, street lights do seem to have a positive effect on peoples sense of safety."

    description: "In addition to looking at the neighborhoods in DC, it is also interesting to see which types of crime that are prevalent in DC in general. In the bar plot, it can be seen that the crime during the day is very skewed towards theft being the far majority of the crimes comitted in DC. The other top 5 crimes are also related to acquiring wealth through crime."
