                Our data set is a mix of 3 data sets. The first data set represents 
                a basic area map of Washington DC, showing the 8 wards in the city. 
                The second data set contains all public data about crime incidents in 
                Washington DC between 2010-2017. The third data set is from Open Data 
                DC and it contains public information about the location and type of 
                street lights in Washington DC.
              </p>
              <p>
                  As inner city crime is a relatively big issue in Washington DC, we 
                  would like to explore if there is a correlation between the occurrence 
                  of crime and the presence of street lights in the streets of Washington DC.	
                  The data sets with the GeoJSON format data allows us to plot the various 
                  types of street lights and the occurrences of crime on an area map of Washington DC.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We want to visualize the areas prone to crime in Washington DC in 
                  an interactive and simple way to the end-user. 
                  The visualization of the density of the street lights in the areas 
                  of crime incidents, should give the user an idea about if the preconception 
                  of dimly lit areas being more crime ridden is true or not.

              <p>Among the important ones are <span style="font-style: italic;">ROADTYPE_DESC</span> which is
                a classification of the street that the light pole exists on. The values are: Street, Alley, Ramp, Highway,
                Trail/Walkway, Service Road and Driveway.</p>

                The total count of streetlights shows that the different types are
                very skewed towards the Street type. The initial plan was to diffirentiate
                between the different types of streetlights, but due to the skewness we have
                choosen to plot them all together as a heatmap. As a result we choose to remove 
                all light attributes except the GPS-coordinates.

                The values for <span style="font-style: italic;">OFFENSE</span> are: Motor cehicle theft, Theft from auto, Theft other, Burglary, 
                Assault weapon, Robbery, Homicide and Sex abuse. The values for <span style="font-style: italic;">SHIFT</span> are: Day, Evening and 
                Midnight. All attributes except <span style="font-style: italic;">OFFENSE</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">SHIFT</span> were 
                from the dataset. As seen in the barchart below the categories of Homicide and Arson contain very few samples compared to the other categories.
                We chose to remove Arson from the dataset but retain Homicide, due to the fact that the spatial distribution of homicide displayed some interesting
                factors in regards to the afflucence of the different neighborhoods.

            Our visualization is an <strong style="color: black;">Interactive Slideshow</strong>, and thus a mix of the 
            narrative visualization genres <strong style="color: black;">Partitioned Poster</strong> and <strong style="color: black;">Slide Show</strong>. The 
            interactive slideshow allows for a great mix of author and reader driven 
            narratives/stories, where each single slide makes use of the Martini 
            Glass Visualization Structure by being preconfigured with default 
            parameters,views or annotations that convey the important points of 
            the current stage of the data story, but also allow the user to 
            change parameters to further explore and interact with the data.

          <p>
            <strong style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Visual Structuring</strong>: A <strong style="color: black;">Progress Tracker</strong> is used to track the users progress through the different slides. 
            The slide show structure also uses a <strong style="color: black;">Consistent Visual Platform</strong> where all similiar components are placed in the same position between different slides, thus avoiding that
            the user gets confused about how to perform the desired actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Highlighting</strong>: <strong style="color: black;">Feature Distinction</strong> in the form of different colors 
            according to the type of data. A yellow overlay on the map of Washington 
            DC with different scales of opacity show the density of streetlights 
            across the city. In order to differentiate between different types of 
            crime incidents different colors are used for the circles according to 
            the type of crime. The crime incident-circles also make use of opacity, 
            such that areas with a high density of crime appear in a darker color. 
            <strong style="color: black;">Zooming</strong> is used as a transition to <strong style="color: black;">Close Ups</strong> of specific parts of the city, 
            such as the city center, that has a higher density of both street lights 
            and crimes and thus require a larger resolution to distinguish the 
            important details of our story.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Transition Guidance</strong>: <strong style="color: black;">Animated Transitions</strong> are used between different 
            zoom-configurations , to better help the user being aware of what 
            is happening between different configurations. If the transitions 
            had been a rough cut from wide view to close up, the user might 
            not know which part of the city the close up represents and thus 
            not be able to relate the information to the rest of the story. 
            We also make use of animated transitions on the crime barcharts 
            for the different years.

            the default configurations helps us tell our data story, and the 
            interactivity of each slide enables the user to investigate the 
            data on his/her own.

            <strong style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Interactivity</strong>: A list of checkboxes is used for <strong style="color: black;">Filtering/Selection</strong>

          <h4 class="explainer-header">Visualizations</h4>
          <p>
            In order to visualize the prevalence of street lights with respect to different areas of DC, we choose to create an overlay on the map, where the opacity corresponds to the amount of streelights computed
            within a certain hexagonal area. The different crime incidents are displayed as a scatteplot on top of the map and the color of the cicrles is used to differentiate 
            between different crime types. Several different buttons allows the user to filter between different configurations of crimetypes, time of day and year of the crimes. A barchart of the top five crimes in all years
            and in total, was chosen in order to viusalize the relative scale of the crime data. Further reasoning behind the different 
            design choices can be found in the Genre-section above.
          </p>
          <h2 class="explainer-header">Discussion</h2>
          <strong style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">What went well</strong>
          <p>
            We found an interesting pair of data sets, to explore and visualize 
            a real life problem. We think the data story in combination with the 
            map and bar chart tells a compelling story, and the user is encouraged 
            to explore further on their own to find their own stories to tell from 
            the visualizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general layout of the page, gives the website a modern feel, and 
            it complements the visualizations, and makes it inviting to the user 
            to explore the page even further. As unrestricted/unguided zoom is not 
            enabled on the 2D map on the front page, the experimental page 
            complements the data, by allowing the user to dive deeper into the data.
          </p>
          <strong style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">What is still missing</strong>
          <p>
            A fully interactive map with zoom, allowing the user to freely navigate the DC map. This approach was partly implemented on the experimental page.
            It would have been nice to include the socio-economic statistics such as the affluence of the different areas as a direct part of the visualization,
            making it easier to differentiate the rich from the poor neighborhoods. This feature was not implemented due to time restraints and the need to 
            include/preprocess an entire extra dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Brushable map and timeline with corresponding statistics in a separate barchart would have increased the amount of dataset exploration possible for
            interested users. A more detailed barchart with hours on the x-axis and amount of crimes on the y-axis, would have allowed for a more detailed 
            exploration of the distribution of different crime types with respect to the time of day. These features were not implemented due to time restraints.
